A two-axis joystick module is a device that provides control over two independent axis, typically referred to as the x-axis and y-axis. The joystick usually consists of a lever or stick that can be moved in two directions, corresponding to the x and y axes. The movement of the lever is usually translated into a change in voltage or resistance, which can be read by a microcontroller or other device to determine the position of the joystick.

Two-axis joysticks are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as controlling the movement of robots, gaming devices, and other electronic devices that require two-dimensional input. They are often used in conjunction with other input devices, such as buttons or switches, to provide a complete interface for controlling a device.
